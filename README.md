# Votex

**Votex** is a decentralized voting platform built on smart contracts, enabling transparent, secure, and tamper-proof voting with the native $VTX token. Designed to empower communities, Votex allows users to launch and participate in voting campaigns with full on-chain verification.

> ðŸª™ **Note:** This is my first Web3 smart contract project, built to learn and explore decentralized governance on the Ethereum blockchain. Iâ€™d love any feedback or suggestions!
